# Spendser - Your personal money manager.

**Spendser**  is a full stack personal money management tool that has been built using MERN stack and TypeScript. 

## Problem Statement
I was planning to develop an app that will help me to analyze all of my transactions and allow me to take better financial decisions. 

## Core Features
* A JWT token based authentication that persists account information even refreshing the page. 
* Ability to Post transaction information that can be represented in the dashboard. 
* Fully customizable dark mode system. 
* An analyzed view of transactions that will allow us to take better financial decisions.

## Tech stack
On the frontend side, I have used **Next.js** version 13.4 with **TailwindCSS**. You can see the whole UI is built on top of **shadcnUI**. The app also includes packages like **Redux**, **zod**, **React-select** etc. This whole project is created using ***TypeScript***. 

## Installation
In order to install this application in your local mechine, you can ***clone*** this repo and run the code below 
```
npm install 
```
To run the installed web app on your local host, you need to run this command: 
```
npm run dev
```

## Contribution 
As it is a personal portfolio project, any contribution to this project cannot be taken. But we have plans to take open source contributions later. So, stay tuned with us.
